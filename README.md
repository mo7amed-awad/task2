Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

PHP >= 8.0
Composer (to manage PHP dependencies)
MySQL or another supported database
Laravel 10.x (latest)
Installation
1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-management.git
cd task-management
2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all required PHP dependencies:

bash
Copy code
composer install
3. Set Up Environment
Copy the example .env file to create your environment configuration file:

bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
4. Configure Database
Edit the .env file and configure your database connection settings:

env
Copy code
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=task_management
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
Ensure your MySQL server is running, and create a new database (task_management in this case) if it doesn’t exist.

5. Generate Application Key
Run this command to generate a unique key for your application:

bash
Copy code
php artisan key:generate
6. Run Migrations
Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables:

bash
Copy code
php artisan migrate
7. Start the Application
Finally, start the application locally:

bash
Copy code
php artisan serve
The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Database Structure
This section explains the structure of your database tables:

Users Table
Laravel automatically creates this table when you implement user authentication. It contains the following fields:

id: Primary key
name: User's full name
email: User's email address (unique)
password: Hashed password
created_at: Timestamp when the account was created
updated_at: Timestamp when the account was last updated
Tasks Table
This table stores information related to tasks:

id: Primary key
title: Title of the task (string, required)
description: Description of the task (text, required)
completion_status: The completion status of the task (enum: completed, notCompleted)
user_id: Foreign key, references the id of the user who created the task (integer, required)
created_at: Timestamp for when the task was created
updated_at: Timestamp for when the task was last updated
Authentication Setup
The application uses Laravel's built-in authentication system to manage users. Users must be authenticated to perform actions on tasks. You can register or log in through the following routes:

/login: Log in to an existing account.
/register: Create a new user account.
/logout: Log out of the application.
Once logged in, tasks will be associated with the authenticated user, and users can only interact with their own tasks.

Running Locally
To run the application locally:

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory.
Install the necessary dependencies using Composer: composer install.
Set up the database and configure it in the .env file.
Run the migrations: php artisan migrate.
Serve the application: php artisan serve.
Open the application in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
Usage
Once you’ve started the application, you can perform the following actions:

User Authentication
Register: Users can sign up using their email address and password.
Log in: Registered users can log in to the system.
Manage Tasks
View Tasks: After logging in, users can view their own tasks.
Create Tasks: Users can create new tasks with a title, description, and status (completed or not completed).
Edit Tasks: Users can edit their existing tasks.
Delete Tasks: Users can delete their tasks.

Key Points to Remember:
Database Configuration: Mention the specific database you're using (MySQL, SQLite, etc.) and how to configure it in the .env file.
Running the Application: The step-by-step instructions to set up and run the app should be clear, especially for people who are not familiar with Laravel.
CRUD Operations: Emphasize how users interact with tasks (creating, updating, deleting), and that only authenticated users can manage their own tasks.
Authentication: Mention that the app uses Laravel's built-in authentication system.
